# **Classification of Chess Pieces using CNN, PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning**

1. Introduction
This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning to classify chess pieces. The model is trained on a custom dataset of chess pieces images.

2. Setup
To set up the project, follow one of these steps:
- Download
- Copy code
- use git clone:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mehdialmoo/s5602288_Software_Eng.git
cd chess-pieces-classification
```
2.1. Install the required packages:
+ use the Environment file:
```bash
conda create .....yml
conda activate SE_ENV
```
3. Dataset
The dataset consists of chess pieces images collected from various sources. It contains 6 classes: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn. The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 60:20:20
