# Introduction

Rubber duck debugging, also known as rubber ducking, is a problem-solving method where the person explains their problem to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck. The act of rubber duck debugging is simple, yet powerful. The person outlines their current understanding of the problem, as well as the possible solutions. The act of verbalizing the problem can help the person discover new angles of thought. They might identify contradictions or potential loopholes in their logic. By articulating the steps they've already taken, they can ensure that they haven't missed anything important. It is particularly effective for individuals who prefer to work in a more exploratory manner.
